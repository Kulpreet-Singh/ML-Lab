A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.',\n",

              " \"Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world. Early Life Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.\",\n",
              " 'Global warming is a hike in the average global temperature on earth. Burning of excess fossil fuel and the release of toxic fumes into the atmosphere is the major cause behind global warming. Global warming can have disastrous effects on living organisms. The impacts of global warming are widespread and unspecific. Some areas experience a sudden rise in the temperature while others witness a sudden fall in it. The major reason for global warming is the burning of fossil fuel for energy. It has been noted that the average temperature on the earth has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius in the past decade. This is a reason for worry as it can damage ecosystems and might result in the disruption of the environment. Global warming can be checked if we take concrete steps towards restoring the lost vegetation in our forests. We can also use clean energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, and tidal energy to check the rise in global warming. Global warming is the cumulative rise in average global temperatures on earth measured over a long period. It has been attributed to the large scale deforestation by man for different purposes. We consume a lot of fuel annually. With an increase in the human population, it has become impossible to meet people’s fuel requirements. Natural resources are limited, and we must use them judiciously. If we exploit natural resources like forests and water bodies, it will create an imbalance in the ecosystem. Global warming is not limited to the rise in temperature. It has other effects too.',\n",
              " 'Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you. Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments. A person who knows music is a Musician. The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists in nature. Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? Thus, everything in harmony has music. Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest musicians, “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.” Importance of Music: Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation. While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste. It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the Gopis would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to Him. Also, the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others.',\n",
              " 'Cricket is celebrated and practiced as a sport in many countries. It is played within a 22-yard oval field with two teams competing against each other. Each team includes 11 players who can be batters, all-rounders as well as bowlers. The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game. India plays cricket both as a sport and a recreation. Youngsters can be seen with their bats and balls in every nook and corner of the country. The Indian Cricket teams of both men and women represent the nation in different tournaments. The dedication and popularity of this game make it larger than life everywhere! Cricket is a game of class, character and commitment. It not only requires years of practice but also passion and dedication. Originally played in Britain, this sport has spread worldwide and made a remarkable impact on the lives of people.',\n",

Technology is when we take something from the world of science and then create it into something that humans use. We must keep our food cold so that it is not spoilt by being out in the warm weather. This concept of science helped scientists develop technology to keep our food cold when we are not eating it by using the fridge. However, all of us like to eat hot food. So, to instantly make food hot, scientists created a microwave. In this way, scientists used technology to help all of us with our daily lives. Technology is very useful in our daily lives. When we look around us, we see a huge number of examples of technology. The mobile phone in our hands, the headphones we wear for listening to music, the microwave we use to heat our food, and even the construction of the buildings we live in – all use some or the other type of technology. Technology is so important in today’s world that it is almost impossible to imagine a life without it. Could you imagine what you would do if you weren’t able to watch television every once?

All of this occurring because of Machine Learning and the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence. Blockchain is the backbone Technology of Digital CryptoCurrency BitCoin. The blockchain is a distributed database of records of all transactions or digital event that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction verified by the majority of participants of the system. It contains every single record of each transaction. BitCoin is the most popular cryptocurrency an example of the blockchain. Blockchain Technology first came to light when a person or Group of individuals name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ published a white paper on “BitCoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system” in 2008. Blockchain Technology Records Transaction in Digital Ledger which is distributed over the Network thus making it incorruptible. Anything of value like Land Assets, Cars, etc. can be recorded on Blockchain as a Transaction. How Blockchain Technology works? One of the famous use of Blockchain is Bitcoin. The bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and is used to exchange digital assets online. Bitcoin uses cryptographic proof instead of third-party trust for two parties to execute transactions over the internet. Each transaction protects through digital signature. Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump\\'s administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world. Early Life Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar. Global warming is a hike in the average global temperature on earth. Burning of excess fossil fuel and the release of toxic fumes into the atmosphere is the major cause behind global warming. Global warming can have disastrous effects on living organisms. The impacts of global warming are widespread and unspecific. Some areas experience a sudden rise in the temperature while others witness a sudden fall in it. The major reason for global warming is the burning of fossil fuel for energy. It has been noted that the average temperature on the earth has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius in the past decade. This is a reason for worry as it can damage ecosystems and might result in the disruption of the environment. Global warming can be checked if we take concrete steps towards restoring the lost vegetation in our forests. We can also use clean energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, and tidal energy to check the rise in global warming. Global warming is the cumulative rise in average global temperatures on earth measured over a long period. It has been attributed to the large scale deforestation by man for different purposes. We consume a lot of fuel annually. With an increase in the human population, it has become impossible to meet people’s fuel requirements. Natural resources are limited, and we must use them judiciously. If we exploit natural resources like forests and water bodies, it will create an imbalance in the ecosystem. Global warming is not limited to the rise in temperature. It has other effects too. Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you. Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments. A person who knows music is a Musician. The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists in nature. Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? Thus, everything in harmony has music. Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest musicians, “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.” Importance of Music: Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation. While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste. It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the Gopis would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to Him. Also, the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others. Cricket is celebrated and practiced as a sport in many countries. It is played within a 22-yard oval field with two teams competing against each other. Each team includes 11 players who can be batters, all-rounders as well as bowlers. The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game. India plays cricket both as a sport and a recreation. Youngsters can be seen with their bats and balls in every nook and corner of the country. The Indian Cricket teams of both men and women represent the nation in different tournaments. The dedication and popularity of this game make it larger than life everywhere! Cricket is a game of class, character and commitment. It not only requires years of practice but also passion and dedication. Originally played in Britain, this sport has spread worldwide and made a remarkable impact on the lives of people. Technology is all around you – in your gaming gadgets like the Wii, Playstation, Xbox, etc. and in your mobile phones, iPads, computers, etc. Most of the things we have in our kitchen, like the microwave, toaster, fridge, etc. are all different types of technology. Technology is when we take something from the world of science and then create it into something that humans use. We must keep our food cold so that it is not spoilt by being out in the warm weather. This concept of science helped scientists develop technology to keep our food cold when we are not eating it by using the fridge. However, all of us like to eat hot food. So, to instantly make food hot, scientists created a microwave. In this way, scientists used technology to help all of us with our daily lives. Technology is very useful in our daily lives. When we look around us, we see a huge number of examples of technology. The mobile phone in our hands, the headphones we wear for listening to music, the microwave we use to heat our food, and even the construction of the buildings we live in – all use some or the other type of technology. Technology is so important in today’s world that it is almost impossible to imagine a life without it. Could you imagine what you would do if you weren’t able to watch television every once? Or what would you do if you were unable to talk to your grandmother who lives away from you on the phone for some time now and then? '"

              "'Humans have long gazed toward the heavens, searching to put meaning and order to the universe around them. Although the movement of constellations — patterns imprinted on the night sky — were the easiest to track, other celestial events such as eclipses and the motion of planets were also charted and predicted.Definition of astronomy: Astronomy is the study of the sun, moon, stars, planets, comets, gas, galaxies, gas, dust and other non-Earthly bodies and phenomena. In curriculum for K-4 students, NASA defines astronomy as simple \"the study of stars, planets and space.\" Astronomy and astrology were historically associated, but astrology is not a science and is no longer recognized as having anything to do with astronomy. Below we discuss the history of astronomy and related fields of study, including cosmology.Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you.

Every time we hear words like “How was that?” or “Bowled out,” we can only think of the heartbeats, the cheering, the pressure and the amazement of a cricket match. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs matches globally whereas the rules of the game are laid down in a code called Laws of Cricket. Every cricket match is played between two teams of 15 players out of which the best and fittest 11 play the match. The match equipment including bat’s weight, usage of the ball, wicket dimensions, position of umpires, etc. are strictly monitored on the field. The format has changed considerably with matches in both limited and unlimited overs. In addition to large scale tournaments like the World Cup, country-based premier leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL) and Champions League (CLT20) have gained popularity. The major national team rivalries in cricket are seen between England and Australia, India and Pakistan, South Africa and England with nail-biting matches.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.An exciting branch of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning is all around us in this modern world. Like Facebook suggesting the stories in your feed, Machine Learning brings out the power of data in a new way. Working on the development of computer programs that can access data and perform tasks automatically through predictions and detections, Machine Learning enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience continuously. As you feed the machine with more data, thus enabling the algorithms that cause it to “learn,” you improve on the delivered results. When you ask Alexa to play your favorite music station on the Amazon Echo, she will go to the one you have played the most; the station is made better by telling Alexa to skip a song, increase volume, and other various inputs. All of this occurring because of Machine Learning and the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence.Blockchain is the backbone Technology of Digital CryptoCurrency BitCoin.

            "['Humans have long gazed toward the heavens searching to put meaning and order to the universe around them Although the movement of constellations — patterns imprinted on the night sky — were the easiest to track other celestial events such as eclipses and the motion of planets were also charted and predictedDefinition of astronomy Astronomy is the study of the sun moon stars planets comets gas galaxies gas dust and other nonEarthly bodies and phenomena In curriculum for K4 students NASA defines astronomy as simple the study of stars planets and space Astronomy and astrology were historically associated but astrology is not a science and is no longer recognized as having anything to do with astronomy Below we discuss the history of astronomy and related fields of study including cosmology', 'Coronaviruses CoV are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERSCoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARSCoV A novel coronavirus nCoV is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans Coronaviruses are zoonotic meaning they are transmitted between animals and people Detailed investigations found that SARSCoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERSCoV from dromedary camels to humans Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and breathing difficulties In more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing thoroughly cooking meat and eggs Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing', 'Initially popular as the “Gentleman’s Game” cricket

Australia India and Pakistan South Africa and England with nailbiting matches', 'An exciting branch of Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning is all around us in this modern world Like Facebook suggesting the stories in your feed Machine Learning brings out the power of data in a new way Working on the development of computer programs that can access data and perform tasks automatically through predictions and detections Machine Learning enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience continuously As you feed the machine with more data thus enabling the algorithms that cause it to “learn” you improve on the delivered results When you ask Alexa to play your favorite music station on the Amazon Echo she will go to the one you have played the most the station is made better by telling Alexa to skip a song increase volume and other various inputs All of this occurring because of Machine Learning and the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence', 'Blockchain is the

release of toxic fumes into the atmosphere is the major cause behind global warming Global warming can have disastrous effects on living organisms The impacts of global warming are widespread and unspecific Some areas experience a sudden rise in the temperature while others witness a sudden fall in it The major reason for global warming is the burning of fossil fuel for energy It has been noted that the average temperature on the earth has increased by 15 degrees Celsius in the past decade This is a reason for worry as it can damage ecosystems and might result in the disruption of the environment Global warming can be checked if we take concrete steps towards restoring the lost vegetation in our forests We can also use clean energy sources like wind energy solar energy and tidal energy to check the rise in global warming Global warming is the cumulative rise in average global temperatures on earth measured over a long period It has been attributed to the large scale deforestation by man for different purposes We consume a lot of fuel annually With an increase in the human population it has become impossible to meet people’s fuel requirements Natural resources are limited and we must use them judiciously If we exploit natural resources like forests and water bodies it will create an imbalance in the ecosystem Global warming is not limited to the rise in temperature It has other effects too', 'Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments A person who knows music is a Musician The music consists of Sargam Ragas Taals etc Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists in nature Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river Could you hear music there Thus everything in harmony has music Here I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart one of the greatest musicians “The music is not in the notes but in the silence between” Importance of Music Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally Music is a form of meditation While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries sorrows and pains But in order to appreciate good music we need to cultivate our musical taste It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug the Gopis would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute They would surrender themselves to Him Also the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others', 'Cricket is celebrated and practiced as a sport in many countries It is played within a 22yard oval field with two teams competing against

gaming gadgets like the Wii Playstation Xbox etc and in your mobile phones iPads computers etc Most of the things we have in our kitchen like the microwave toaster fridge etc are all different types of technology Technology is when we take something from the world of science and then create it into something that humans use We must keep our food cold so that it is not spoilt by being out in the warm weather This concept of science helped scientists develop technology to keep our food cold when we are not eating it by using the fridge However all of us like to eat hot food So to instantly make food hot scientists created a microwave In this way scientists used technology to help all of us with our daily lives Technology is very useful in our daily lives When we look around us we see a huge number of examples of technology The mobile phone in our hands the headphones we wear for listening to music the microwave we use to heat our food and even the construction of the buildings we live in – all use some or the other type of technology Technology is so important in today’s world that it is almost impossible to imagine a life without it Could you imagine what you would do if you weren’t able to watch television every once Or what would you do if you were unable to talk to your grandmother who lives away from you on the phone for some time now and then']\n"

seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound the most most the and definitely the most episodic I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was was not as and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a I have heard many strange reasons such Because Yoda died Because Bobba Fett died Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers Because Darth Vader was would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point First WHO CARES if Bobba Fett If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I many fans did not like Yoda it was a momentous period in the I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more All the good guys stay alive in a realistic you Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning Another aspect to this point about people not liking nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New consider A New Hope to be the best of the Why was Obi death okay but Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be That is utterly I can not believe this First the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your They had swinging logs set up to trip those and other The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the The only thing they had was their To it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars the band of as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home that would have been a great if this scene was still unbelievable to How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han and the being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full And not only the heroes of always hit the Stormtroopers with their The troopers must have VERY bad aim At least in Empire Strikes the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of believe Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at they Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death last reason that I care to discuss are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time is that people did not like Darth Vader being in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his Annakin It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his face because it made it By revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side his and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker removing the The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was In is what I would have done in that scene too if I were that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized another I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse if it is that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it I never go into a film with that deception in I always try to go into a film with the attitude that it might be better or worse that the original But I can not know for That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really am not sure who criticizes these movies I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me for one person that said that A New Hope was their that it is I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite the Return of the Jedi was the best of the This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either or all of the For the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for insignificant details see it as another to trash the movie such as movie stinks because Luke is not in then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered',\n",
