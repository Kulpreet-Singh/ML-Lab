Alpaydin (alpaydin '@' boun.edu.tr)\\n    :Date: July; 1998\\n\\nThis is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets\\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits\\n\\nThe data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where\\neach class refers to a digit.\\n\\nPreprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract\\nnormalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a\\ntotal of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13\\nto the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of\\n4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates\\nan input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range\\n0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small\\ndistortions.\\n\\nFor info on NIST preprocessing routines, see M. D. Garris, J. L. Blue, G.\\nT. Candela, D. L. Dimmick, J. Geist, P. J.

       " 'I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound the most most the and definitely the most episodic I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was was not as and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a I have heard many strange reasons such Because Yoda died Because Bobba Fett died Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers Because Darth Vader was would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point First WHO CARES if Bobba Fett If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I many fans did not like Yoda it was a momentous period in the I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more All the good guys stay alive in a realistic you Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning Another aspect to this point about people not liking nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New consider A New Hope to be the best of the Why was Obi death okay but Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be That is utterly I can not believe this First the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your They had swinging logs set up to trip those and other The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the The only thing they had was their To it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars the band of as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home that would have been a great if this scene was still unbelievable to How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han and the being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full And not only the heroes of always hit the Stormtroopers with their The troopers must have VERY bad aim At least in Empire Strikes the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of believe Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at they Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death last reason that I care to discuss are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time is that people did not like Darth Vader being in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his Annakin It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his face because it made it By revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side his and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker removing the The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was In is what I would have done in that scene too if I were that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized another I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse if it is that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it I never go into a film with that deception in I always try to go into a film with the attitude that it might be better or worse that the original But I can not know for That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really am not sure who criticizes these movies I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me for one person that said that A New Hope was their that it is I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite the Return of the Jedi was the best of the This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either or all of the For the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for insignificant details see it as another to trash the movie such as movie stinks because Luke is not in then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered',\n",

The dataset is taken\\nfrom Fisher\\'s paper. Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. topic:: References\\n\\n   - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n     Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n     Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n   - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.
